I received had a tutoring session with Kourt Bailey, who helped me set up my constants so that there were not too many numbers floating throughout my code.  He also helped me input comments into my code and organize my for loop with inputs, calculations, and outputs.
I used my Joan's (my classmates suggestion to create a second for loop to output the greatest values.  I initially had them in my original for loop and it was running, but then stopped when I copied and pasted the code into the big multi-year spreadhseet.
I also took my Liz's (my classmate) suggestion of adding an if statement for the color coding directly underneath the line where the yearly_change was calculated.  I originally had that after the first if statement, but that stopped working as well when I copied and pasted.
